- Genshin Impact's game installed
- Tao Mod Manager installed
- Dynamic Character Resolution disabled in Genshin Impact settings

## Step 1 - Open Tao Mod Manager

Tao Mod Manager requires administrator privileges, as it needs permission to run the Genshin Impact executable.

## Step 2 - Set your Genshin Impact's executable path in Settings

Now we need to configure the path to your Genshin Impact executable in the settings.

Open the **Settings** section in Tao Mod Manager.

Press **Select** button.

Choose your Genshin Impact executable file.

> [!TIP]
> If you're not sure where Genshin Impact is installed, you can check the path using the HoYoMix launcher.

## Step 3 - Import your first Genshin Impact's model

Once the Genshin Impact path is set, you're ready to import your first model. You can find many models on [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/mods/cats/18140). In this example, we’ll use [Knight Amber](https://gamebanana.com/mods/436924) by [CR00T_R0M](https://gamebanana.com/members/2190560).

After downloading the model, you’ll have a .zip file.

To import it into Tao Mod Manager, click the **IMPORT** icon:

![Import Icon](../screenshots/import.png)

Then select the `.zip` or `.rar` file:

The model will be successfully imported:

## Step 4 - Run the App

Click the Play button in the top-right corner of the app:

![Model imported succesfully](../screenshots/play.png)

Genshin Impact will launch with your imported models:

## Optional - Fix Skins

Is your skin bugged? This could be due to compatibility issues between the model and the latest version of Genshin Impact's renderer. Tao Mod Manager includes a skin fixer:

![Fixer button](../screenshots/fixer.png)

Clicking this will automatically fix all your enabled skins.
